# FileAddTimeString

FileAddTimeString is a simple tool that appends the current timestamp to the end of a file or directory name, making it useful for creating time-stamped backups of files.

## Usage:
```
FileAddTimeString.exe <filename>
```

## Installation (e.g. on Windows):
1. Save the executable file to any location.
2. Create a shortcut to the executable. (Right-click on the .exe file and select "Create shortcut".)
3. Move the shortcut to `%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\SendTo` for quick access from the right-click context menu.

4. This allows you to easily create backups with unique names by simply right-clicking on a file or directory and selecting "Send to" -> "FileAddTimeString".
